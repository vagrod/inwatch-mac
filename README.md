# InWatch:mac
A very old project from 2010: automatic file categorizer for macos. It was a project to try Cocoa Objectice-C on.
This app watches any configured folters, and if file appears there, it looks on your configuration and decides to move or copy this file to another location.

I don't have any screenshots, but I found a very old [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfb3fSMT9Pg) showcasing the thing. It's in 360p max now, but when I uploaded it back then, it was 1080 :)

Uploading these sources just not to lose them completely.
